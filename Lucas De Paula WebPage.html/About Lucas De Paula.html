<h1> About Lucas De Paula </h1>

<h2> Who is he? </h2>

<p> Lucas De Paula is a 17-year-old High School Senior (born on January 4th, 2006). Lucas was born in San Francisco but lived his whole childhood in Brazil, and because of that despite being born in the U.S. he did not know how to speak English, it was only after he moved back to the U.S. in 2017 that he began to learn the English language. Lucas is the oldest of siblings (1 younger brother and 1 younger sister), despite how annoying he thinks his siblings can be sometimes, he is always looking out for them. </p>

<h2> Why Is He At CSM? </h2>

<p> As previously stated Lucas is still in high school. So you might be asking, why is he taking college classes if heâ€™s still in high school? The answer to that is he joined a program called Middle College where high school juniors and seniors get the chance to finish their last two years of high school at either CSM or Skyline, therefore, being able to take college level courses. </p>
